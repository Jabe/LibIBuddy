# LibIBuddy
LibIBuddy is an open source project by [Gl√ºck & Kanja Consulting AG](http://www.glueckkanja.com). It is a library to control the [i-Buddy](http://www.i-buddy.com) from any .NET programming language.

## Acknowledgements
Part of the code is based on [Lync Buddy](https://lyncbuddy.codeplex.com/) by Tommy Clarke. The issue with the i-Buddy getting extremely hot has been fixed in LibIBuddy (bits for "off" have been inverted).
